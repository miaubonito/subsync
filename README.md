# SubSync

The SubSync is a CLI application written in Python. In the MVP version of the app locally installed models will be used to transcribe videos and translate subtitles to another language. The main goal of SubSync app is to quickly prepare subtitles and their translations for YouTube videos.

## Run the project

### Prerequisites

To run the project it's required to have Python3 and `uv` installed.

#### Python

Check if you have Python3 installed:

```shell
python3 --version
```

In case you don't have it, install Python3 or install directly `uv` which will allow you to manage Python versions.

#### UV

Check if `uv` is installed on your OS:

```shell
uv --version
```

If it's not, install it using:

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Restart terminal to have `uv` and `uvx` available. In my case it's ZSH:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Run the app

To run it use:

```shell
uv run subsync
```

At this stage it will output this simple message:

```text
Hello World
```
